<h1>Ant Kingdom</h1>
 
 
 <body>
"Ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to <strong>highly organised</strong> colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals. <br> Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile, wingless females, most of which are workers (ergates), as well as soldiers (dinergates) and other specialised groups. <br> Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called <em>"drones" (aner)</em> and one or more fertile females called <em> "queens" (gynes)</em>. <br> The colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony."

  <h3>Reproduction</h3>
<p> "A wide range of reproductive strategies have been noted in ant species. Females of many species are known to be capable of reproducing asexually through thelytokous parthenogenesis. Secretions from the male accessory glands in some species can plug the female genital opening and prevent females from re-mating. Most ant species have a system in which only the queen and breeding females have the ability to mate. Contrary to popular belief, some ant nests have multiple queens, while others may exist without queens. Workers with the ability to reproduce are called "gamergates" and colonies that lack queens are then called gamergate colonies; colonies with queens are said to be queen-right."</p>
